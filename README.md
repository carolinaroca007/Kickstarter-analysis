"# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns"

"### Using Pivot table and Charts to Illustrate Data"
Created a pivot table and chart to separate and illustrate the outcomes of theater in the United States; The data shows that theater is quite successful.
Created a pivot table and chart to separate and illustrate the outcomes of plays in the United States; The data shows that plays are also successul.
This is important to highlight because our analysis was focused on understanding the success rate of plays, a subcategory of theater, in the United States.

Created a time series chart to help identify trends over time and noticed that successful Theather campaigns spiked in the May to June timeframe. 

"### Using Descriptive Statistics to Help Us Decode Data"
Using measures of central tendency and measures of spread against Kickstarter campaign goals and pledges, we were able to identify that failed kickstarter campaign had twice the funding goal than successful kickstarter campaigns - this may indicate that in order to turn more sucessful campaigns, we need to consider lowering the funding goals. 
The mean and median of successful kickstarter campaigns were also very close compared to failed kickstarter campaigns who had large differences between goal and plegded.

Used a box and whisker plot to illustrate outliers in the data set and compared goal and pledged numbers for musicals in Great Britain. The data shows that 25% of musicals saw little to no funding. 

Based on the findings, theather and plays are successful in the United States and the most successul theater campaigns have been in May and June. The most successful kickstarter campaigns have more realistic and attainable goals. I recommend Louise to use these important takeaways to guide her in her decision making.
